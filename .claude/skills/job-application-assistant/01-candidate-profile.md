# Candidate Profile

<!-- Populated by /setup on 2026-08-05 from documents/cv/ and documents/linkedin/.
     Safe to re-run /setup after adding more documents — it merges rather than overwrites. -->

## Identity
- **Name:** John C. Thadison, Jr. (goes by John Thadison)
- **Location:** Cedar Falls, IA (Waterloo–Cedar Falls area)
- **Contact details:** see `contact.local.md` at the repo root — phone, email,
  postal code and profile URLs live there. That file is **gitignored**, because
  this repository is public and city/state is all the Location Gate needs.
  `/apply` must read it when generating a CV or cover letter; if it is missing,
  stop and ask rather than inventing or omitting contact details.
- **Status:** Between roles, actively searching. Departed Moov Financial 07/2026; available immediately.
- **Constraints:** **Remote-first, US-wide.** Based in Cedar Falls, IA — a thin local market for
  senior backend roles, so fully-remote US positions are the primary target. Not currently seeking
  relocation. Prior two roles were remote or remote-capable (Brightwell was Atlanta-based).

### Languages

| Language | Level | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| English | Native | US-based, US-only search. |

<!-- Only English is declared. If you work professionally in another language, add it — the
Language Gate in 04-job-evaluation.md treats an UNDECLARED language required by a posting as a
hard exclusion, so an omission costs you matches rather than protecting you. -->

## Education

| Degree | Period | Institution | Key Topics |
|--------|--------|-------------|------------|
| M.S., Computer Engineering Technology | 08/1998 – 05/2000 | University of Southern Mississippi, Hattiesburg | Computer engineering technology |
| B.S., Computer Engineering Technology | 08/1993 – 05/1998 | University of Southern Mississippi, Hattiesburg | Computer engineering technology |

<!-- The LinkedIn export lists these four times with a merged 1993–2000 range; the split above
     is from the CV and is the accurate one. -->

<!-- Consolidation note (confirmed with candidate 2026-08-05): LinkedIn additionally lists
     WorldCom (Sr Applications Developer, 1998–2006) and MCI (Senior Applications Developer,
     2003–2005). These are the same corporate lineage — WorldCom acquired MCI in 1998, renamed
     to MCI in 2003, and Verizon acquired MCI in 2006. The candidate elected to keep the CV's
     consolidated "Verizon Business 2000–2006" entry. If a posting rewards maximum tenure, the
     fuller history reaches back to 1998. LinkedIn also shows earlier start dates for Deloitte
     (05/2010, Senior Consultant) and BearingPoint (01/2006, Applications Developer III), which
     appear to be role changes within the same employers. -->

## Technical Skills

### Programming & Frameworks
- **Go** (professional, most recent): 50+ microservices, event-driven architecture on GCP
  <!-- SCOPE GUARD (confirmed by candidate 2026-08-05): event-driven / message-based
       architecture experience is the ONE year at Moov (07/2025-07/2026), not four years and
       not career-length. Brightwell was distributed systems and REST/API integration on
       Azure, NOT event-driven. Do not write "event-driven services are what I have built
       for the last four years" or any equivalent — that conflates the 4-year payments span
       with the 1-year event-driven span. The honest and still-strong claim is "my most
       recent year, across more than 50 Go microservices."
       Related: Kafka is COURSEWORK ONLY (LinkedIn Learning). Moov's event-driven work was
       on GCP. Never imply Kafka production experience, including by juxtaposition with an
       employer's Kafka usage — do not pair "your stack uses Kafka" with "I build
       event-driven services" in adjacent sentences, which reads as a claim.
       When a posting requires more event-driven tenure than one year, address the gap
       honestly rather than omitting it: lead with the specific (50+ Go microservices, GCP,
       production) and let recency carry the weight duration cannot. -->
- **C# / .NET** (expert, 20+ years): .NET Core, .NET Framework, Entity Framework, ASP.NET MVC, Web APIs
- **Java** (expert): J2EE, Spring, Hibernate, JSF
- **TypeScript / Angular**: full-stack SaaS front ends
- **SQL**: schema design and optimization

### Domain Expertise
- **Payments / fintech — ~4 years, recent and contiguous (2022–2026).** Brightwell 06/2022–04/2025
  (ReadyRemit cross-border platform, Visa/Mastercard API integrations, millions of transactions)
  and Moov Financial 07/2025–07/2026 (payments company; Go microservices on an event-driven
  platform). Plus 5 months at VGM 11/2014–03/2015 on DME credit-card authorization and billing.
  <!-- ACCURACY NOTE: this is FOUR years of payments, not 26. Do NOT describe the payments
       background as spanning the whole career. Verizon Business (2000–2006) was telecom revenue
       management and billing audit — large-scale financial data, but NOT fintech or payments, and
       it must not be counted toward payments tenure. The honest and still-strong framing is
       "four years in payments, current through 2026" — recency and depth, not duration. -->
- **Large-scale financial data (adjacent, not payments)** — revenue management and billing audit
  systems at Verizon Business (2000–2006): accuracy, performance and scale over financial records
- **Distributed systems & microservices** — event-driven architecture (Moov, 2025-2026), API design (REST), 99.9% reliability at scale (Brightwell)
- **Government / public sector** — Department of Homeland Security, Naval Oceanographic Office
- **Geospatial / GIS** — ArcGIS Server, ESRI JTX, scientific data visualization

### Databases
- PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle, Azure Blob Storage; schema design, performance tuning, query optimization

### Cloud, DevOps & Tooling
- **Microsoft Azure** (Azure DevOps, Application Insights, Blob Storage), **Google Cloud Platform**
- CI/CD pipelines, Infrastructure as Code, OpenTelemetry, Docker/Kubernetes (coursework)
- Git & GitHub, Subversion
- **AI-assisted engineering**: Claude Code, Codex, custom skill authoring, MCP servers

### Testing
- Unit testing & TDD, NUnit, automated testing frameworks, performance monitoring

### Leadership & Collaboration
- Technical mentorship, team leadership (7 engineers), hiring and interviewing, performance management, strategic planning, technical roadmap development, cross-functional collaboration, stakeholder communication

## Certifications
- **Microsoft Certified: Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900)** — Microsoft, 01/2025

<!-- The LinkedIn "Certifications" panel lists LinkedIn Learning course completions (Learning
     Docker, Learning Kubernetes, The AI-Driven Software Developer, Apache Kafka Essential
     Training, Microservices Foundations) — coursework, not credentials, so they are not listed
     as certifications. AZ-900 is absent from LinkedIn and worth adding there. -->
